A small personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in multiple languages for learning, comparison and experimentation.

## Repository goals

- Practice algorithm and data structure problems from LeetCode.
- Compare idiomatic solutions across languages.
- Keep small, runnable examples and minimal instructions to run them locally.

## Repository structure

Top-level folders typically contain solutions grouped by language. Example:

- `Dart/` — Dart solutions (e.g. `P1.dart`)
- `C/` — C solutions
- `Cpp/` — C++ solutions
- `Python/` — Python solutions
- `Java/` — Java solutions

Files are named by problem number or short descriptive name, e.g. `P1.dart`, `p1.py`, `P1.java`, etc.

## Conventions

- File names prefixed with `P<number>` or `p<number>` correspond to LeetCode problem numbers.
- Keep solutions minimal and focused on the algorithm. Tests are small and ad-hoc unless otherwise stated.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues or add solution files. Keep each solution in the appropriate language folder and follow the naming convention.

## License

This repository is personal practice and may be distributed under the default license you prefer. If you want a formal license, add a `LICENSE` file.
